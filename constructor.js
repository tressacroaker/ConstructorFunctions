//Contructer Functions

//1. Create an array called bands with 3 objects in it. Each of them describes a music band. Each object should have a name, genre, numberOfPerformers, and numberOfGroupies.

//Now create a constructor function called Band. Have it take in a name, genre, numberOfPerformers, and numberOfGroupies. Set the keys to have the value of the parameters using the this keyword.

//Now create those same bands you made before using the constructor function Band using the new keyword. Plug in the values for each of the object keys as argumeters.

//Now create a new array called newBands and push each of the objects that you made into that array.

//Alright, you have created new objects using a constructor function. Let's say we want to add a new key to the constructor function. To do so, go ahead and create a method called bandInfo using the prototype methos for the Band constructor. Let's have the bandInfo method alert the band's name and their music genre.
